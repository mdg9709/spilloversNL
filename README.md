# spilloversNL

# This repository contains the R files used to estimate fiscal spillovers between the Netherlands and four large Eurozone countries.
# The analysis is based on Alloza et al. (2019) and is discussed in my MSc Economics thesis.
# I am making these files public because the analysis does not fit entirely into the time scope of this thesis.
# Finalizing and improving the replicated analysis could have significant implications for fiscal policy in the Netherlands.
# Therefore I encourage future master students or other scholars to complete this replication study by means of the R files.
# Because large part of the data used was confidentially shared with me by dr. Alloza, please contact me to get access to the Excel files.
