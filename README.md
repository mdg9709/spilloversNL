# spilloversNL

# This repository contains R Studio files with code used to estimate fiscal spillovers between the Netherlands and four large Eurozone countries.
# The analysis is based on Alloza et al. (2019) and is discussed in my MSc Economics thesis.
# I am making these files public because the analysis does not fit entirely into the time scope of this thesis.
